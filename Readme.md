# Rich Text Editor for WinForms - How to Copy a Table to the Clipboard in the UnicodeText Format

With the current implementation, our RichEditControl component copies each table cell as a separate paragraph into the Clipboard in the Text format. As a result, the tabular structure of the copied content is lost when you paste it into a Notepad or Microsoft Office Excel document. 
You can replace the default [CopySelectionCommand](https://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/clsDevExpressXtraRichEditCommandsCopySelectionCommandtopic) command with a custom command to change this behavior. See the `ExecuteCore` method implementation of the `CustomCopySelectionCommand` class in this example. In this method, text is obtained for the OfficeDataFormats.UnicodeText format is postprocessed to separate cell content with Tab symbols.
